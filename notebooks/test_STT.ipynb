And then what is your email address Mr. Ms. Mthongo? Mahalamstongo. Mahalamstongo. Mahalamstongo. Small letters, right? Yes. Oh okay. No problem then sir. So do you have an alternative number? No. All right. So please ensure that you do make the payment to avoid contract suspending the services you're casing, including having access to the F and positioning of your VHS through control room. Okay. All right. Do you have any questions? No. No problem. So we'll do the deduction then of the amount of 288,310 on the 4th of next month and your monthly subscription is going to be deducted on the same day also. Okay. No problem then sir.
