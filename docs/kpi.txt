## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Automated Evaluation Pipeline**:
   - Implement real-time KPI tracking during simulations
   - Create dashboard visualization of key metrics
   - Set up alerts for metrics falling below thresholds

2. **Ongoing Optimization Process**:
   - Use A/B testing to compare script variations
   - Implement weekly review cycles for lowest-performing KPIs
   - Maintain a benchmark database for comparing performance over time

3. **Balanced Scorecard Approach**:
   - Weight KPIs based on business priorities (e.g., compliance = highest)
   - Create combined score across categories
   - Set improvement targets by category

4. **Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation**:
   - Supplement automated metrics with expert reviews
   - Conduct periodic calibration sessions
   - Document qualitative insights alongside quantitative measures
