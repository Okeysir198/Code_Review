## ðŸ“Š Decision Matrix

| Factor | Version 1 (Full LiveKit) | Version 2 (Hybrid) |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Implementation Time | 3-4 weeks | 1-2 weeks |
| Risk Level | Medium | Low |
| Performance | Excellent | Good |
| Maintenance | Low | Medium |
| Future-Proof | Yes | Transitional |
| Team Training | Required | Minimal |

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation

**Start with Version 2** for immediate improvements (1-2 weeks), then migrate to **Version 1** for long-term benefits (additional 2-3 weeks).

This approach:
- Validates LiveKit benefits with minimal risk
- Allows gradual team learning
- Provides fallback options
- Ensures smooth transition
